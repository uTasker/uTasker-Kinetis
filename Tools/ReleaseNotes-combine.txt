Version V1.1 14-10-2009
=======================

"uTaskerCombine -v" to get the version number.

Utility used to combine two binary files into a single file - often used to combine a boot loader with application
code to result in a single downloadable file.

Use "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0x1000 file3.bin"

Adds the content of file 2 at an offset of 0x1000 to the content of file2 (filling and space between the two with 0xff)
and saves the result to file3.bin.

Option = "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0x1000 file3.bin file4.ihex"

Adding a further file causes the resulting binary to be also saved in file4.ihex in Intel hex format. This is mainly
used for NXP projects where the program FlashMagic is used to program the combined binary file, but requires the code
to be in this format.


Version V1.2 20-09-2012
=======================

Option = "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0x1000 file3.bin file4.srec"

If the optional hex file has an extension .srec or .out it is considered as requiring Motorola S-REC instead.

Option = "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0x1000 file3.bin file4.srec 0x80000000"

An address following the hex file output is interpreted as an offset to be added to the content of the hex file - for example
the AVR32 has its code in internal flash starting at 0x80000000 and so requires this offset to load to the correct address.

If the exact format of the srec file is to be controlled it can be done so by specifying S1, S2 or S3 after the file name
(before any optional offset) eg. "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0x1000 file3.bin file4.srec S3 0x80000000"

Version V1.3 21-01-2016
=======================

Allow concatenating two binary files by defining 0 offset.

Option = "uTaskerCombine file1.bin file2.bin 0 file3.bin file4.srec"


Version V1.4 19-04-2016
=======================

Correct optional offset when building with VS2010, respecting that the input is now in unicode


Version V1.5 31-07-2017
=======================

Terminate iHex line with CR + LF (rather than just LF)


Version V1.6 17-03-2020
=======================

Correctly recognise srec/ihex files in unicode
