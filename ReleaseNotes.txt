- _EXTENDED_HTTP_MIME_CONTENT_SUPPORT activates HTTP content-type to be added to HTTP header
- Magic Ethernet frame reception support added
"The define _MAGIC_RESET_FRAME enables magic frame checking support.
Initially no checking is done until it is enabled by calling fnEnableMagicFrames(1).
It can later be disabled if require by calling fnEnableMagicFrames(0).
When active, each received Ethernet frame is checked directly in the receive interrupt routine for Ethernet payloads of 93 bytes in length.
The definition of _MAGIC_RESET_FRAME determines the magic frame pattern that is expected (repeated 16 bit value) - for example
#define _MAGIC_RESET_FRAME        0x1234
A magic frame must then contain this value repeated 24 times in the first 60 bytes of the payload (following the two Ethernet II MAC addresses) in order to be recognised.
The 61st byte in the frame can then be used as code to trigger an action. The value 0x01 causes the board to reset and place a code in the boot loader mail box so that the boot loader can recognise that the board was reset via use of a magic frame. The boot loader will normally remain in the boot loader mode (possibly for a limited period of time) to allow software updates to be accepted.
The final 32 bytes of the frame are undefined and can have any pattern. The user can use these as optional information bytes if required (for example, there is adequate space to pass 2 IPv6 addresses for special configuration purposes, etc.)
The handling interface has to be supplied by the user (eg. in application.c) as follows:
extern void fnMagicFrame(unsigned char ucType, unsigned char usOptionalDate[32]) {}"

- I2C lockup detection and recovery added to I2C driver (if a reset took place when a slave device was in the process of returning an acknowledgment the I2C bus can get stuck in a bus busy state - this is detected and clocks generated on the SCL line to free the slave and allow normal operation without requiring a power cycle)
- HID loader support for Freescale PC program "HIDBootloader.exe" from the application note AN4764 "Freescale HID Bootloader"
- FRDM-K64F configuration changes to match some K64 peripherals and board requirements

IMPORTANT: This release is configured by default for the FRDM-K64F and so can be imported directly into KDS. To work with CodeWarrior copy the Eclipse project files from \Applications\uTaskerV1.4\KinetisCodeWarrior\ProjectSettings to the project root directory after removing the KDS ones from that location; switch between CW10.x, KDS and Atollic using the same method - there is a corresponding set of Eclipse project files in:
- \Applications\uTaskerV1.4\KinetisDesignStudio\Project_Settings
- \Applications\uTaskerV1.4\KinetisCodeWarrior\ProjectSettings
- \Applications\uTaskerV1.4\KinetisAtollic\Project_Settings
It is recommended to keep a backup of these settings when switching between IDEs in case one environment corrupts the setting of others.
